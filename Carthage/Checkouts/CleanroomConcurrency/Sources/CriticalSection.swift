 `CriticalSection`s can be used to ensure exclusive access to a given resource.

 By protecting a resource with a `CriticalSection`, you ensure that only one
 one thread can be executing code using that critical section at any given time.

 `CriticalSection`s are re-entrant, meaning that code already holding access
 to the critical section may re-enter the critical section without causing
 a deadlock. (The `NSRecursiveLock` class is used under the hood.)
